### Review Notes

Thank you for reviewing MJ's Superstars!

**Key Points:**
1. MJ is an AI companion, not a replacement for professional mental health care. We clearly state this in the app.
2. Crisis resources are always accessible via the SOS button.
3. All AI conversations use the Anthropic Claude API, which has robust safety measures.
4. HealthKit data is processed locally and never uploaded to our servers.
5. Push notifications require explicit user permission and can be customized.

**To Test:**
- Complete onboarding to see personalization
- Log a few moods to see tracking features
- Try the breathing exercise in Coping Toolkit
- Check the Settings for notification preferences
