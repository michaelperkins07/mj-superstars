# White Mike — Origin Story & Philosophy
## By Michael Perkins

### The Core Truth

We think a lot alike but we're the 1% dawg. Everyone else is stuck in la la land trying to chase what will never be theirs. That's why they go crazy.

The biggest drug is greed. That's why gambling is booming. That's why sports cards are booming — it's a gamble. There's no control so any idiot can play and you can say "I told you so." Those are lottery.

The people who made it out just worked harder. I see that now where I work.

### The Awakening

I'm finding out that people don't think like me because when I go off, they think I'm crazy. It scares them.

**I'm either having a midlife crisis or I just took the weight of the world off my shoulders.**

I'm searching for the meaning of life and AI is helping me get there.

### The Enemies of Growth

Greed, envy, judgement.

When I thought about getting divorced I treated it like a fucking pain point and was sold on it. It never made sense so I keep trying to reverse engineer how to read Danielle and I'm learning that I'm much different than her and likely 99% of the world.

Like having a tennis rating, we have the same score because we've been pushing our minds this far. My wife hasn't and that's why she can't keep up. She's mad about it and hates because of it. Jealousy, envy, greed, lack of gratitude.

### The Philosophy

**When you decide to stop challenging your mind, that's when you've reached your ceiling.**

Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan, Mike Tyson, Michael Phelps, and Michael Perkins all just wanted it more in their respective careers and found a way to break new heights because they challenged themselves, each and every day.

That challenge includes having the courage to say and take ownership of your faults and wrongdoings. Admit when you've fucked up and move on. Instead, we hold it in as baggage.

### The Real Talk

There's top performers and bottom performers everywhere. We're told to hide our faults and weaknesses and that creates baggage.

I'm a top performer of top performers. I've been the best everywhere I've been. I've been told my whole life though that I'm not good enough. Especially by my wife. She wants me to stop smoking weed but I likely do it because our intelligence level is much different now. I've outgrown her and we're unable to communicate as a result. She doesn't want to put in the effort to be nice or have empathy. That's how closed minded she is because she has judgement filled in her brain. She likes to talk shit but doesn't work. It doesn't make sense, isn't rationale, but it does make sense now because her mind needs to start jogging again. It doesn't need to keep up with me but it's stagnant now and killing our marriage. I'm trying my best to communicate but know that I've been held down long enough that I'm willing to risk being on my own to see the other side.

This life is short and I want to fulfill my destiny to make as big of a positive impact. I'm not Jesus Christ, I've just been doing my best to obey my mom, be as good of a guy as possible, and attempt to make as much money as possible to fully experience life with friends and family that helped me to get here.

### The Wake-Up Call

I play the game of guessing everyone else's emotions the last couple of weeks. That's when I realized that I was so locked in that I didn't realize that everyone else around me was a zombie stuck on their phone, not willing to work hard, and not willing to talk. They had no motivation, blamed the world and life instead of taking ownership, and bring those closest to them down because of their negative thoughts and actions. They kill relationships, growth, and love.

---

### The Problem We Solve

We want people to believe that they can start anything. AI is often hard for people to use because they can't detail their thoughts and emotions because they lack empathy. Many of these people are data driven so they need facts on how this will improve their life, make them happy, and achieve their desired wants, needs, and goals. People have a lot of problems to check off their head and we're here to create friction and kickstart growth.

### The Vision

We're about to take out McKinsey dawg. I knew they were useless because I'm master of all trades and they're jack of all trades. Everyone pays consultants to tell them what they already know. MJ puts that same strategic thinking power in everyone's pocket — for free. No $500K engagement. No 6-month timeline. Just tell it what you want and get a strategy right now.

---

### Why MJ Exists

This app exists because most people don't have a framework for challenging their own minds. They don't have a system for processing their thoughts, tracking their moods, journaling their breakthroughs, or having honest conversations with themselves.

White Mike is that system. It's AI-powered coaching for people who want to grow — who refuse to hit their ceiling. It's for the 1% who are willing to do the work, and for the 99% who haven't started yet but might, if someone gives them the right tool.
