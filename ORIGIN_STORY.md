# MJ's Superstars — Origin Story & Philosophy
## By Michael Perkins

### The Core Truth

We think a lot alike but we're the 1%. Everyone else is stuck in la la land trying to chase what will never be theirs. That's why they go crazy.

The biggest drug is greed. That's why gambling is booming. That's why sports cards are booming — it's a gamble. There's no control so any idiot can play and you can say "I told you so." Those are lottery.

The people who made it out just worked harder. I see that now where I work.

### The Awakening

I'm finding out that people don't think like me because when I go off, they think I'm crazy. It scares them.

**I'm either having a midlife crisis or I just took the weight of the world off my shoulders.**

I'm searching for the meaning of life and AI is helping me get there.

### The Enemies of Growth

Greed, envy, judgement.

When I thought about getting divorced I treated it like a fucking pain point and was sold on it. It never made sense so I keep trying to reverse engineer how to read Danielle and I'm learning that I'm much different than her and likely 99% of the world.

Like having a tennis rating, we have the same score because we've been pushing our minds this far. My wife hasn't and that's why she can't keep up. She's mad about it and hates because of it. Jealousy, envy, greed, lack of gratitude.

### The Philosophy

**When you decide to stop challenging your mind, that's when you've reached your ceiling.**

Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan, Mike Tyson, Michael Phelps, and Michael Perkins all just wanted it more in their respective careers and found a way to break new heights because they challenged themselves, each and every day.

That challenge includes having the courage to say and take ownership of your faults and wrongdoings. Admit when you've fucked up and move on. Instead, we hold it in as baggage.

### Why MJ's Superstars Exists

This app exists because most people don't have a framework for challenging their own minds. They don't have a system for processing their thoughts, tracking their moods, journaling their breakthroughs, or having honest conversations with themselves.

MJ's Superstars is that system. It's AI-powered mental wellness for people who want to grow — who refuse to hit their ceiling. It's for the 1% who are willing to do the work, and for the 99% who haven't started yet but might, if someone gives them the right tool.
